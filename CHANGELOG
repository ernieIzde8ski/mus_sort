# Changelog

## original-branch : unlabeled versions - 2021.10.17:2022.04.19

Many things not worth going over, and pro8a8ly many more actively worth forgetting, but
most importantly, music sorting. Probably the most severe flaw of this branch was being
limited to a single folder, which modularization immediately rectified in the module_v2
branch.

## pypi-module : unlabeled versions - 2022.05.05

A basic structure was developed and a sorting algorithm *was* written, but for whichever
reasons, this attempt didn't work out. Several commits for it can be found
[here.](https://github.com/ernieIzde8ski/mus_sort/compare/5fa2ee7d3d69%5E...33f326eab029)

## module_v2 : 0.0.1 - 2022.07.07

- add various files to make suitable as a module (README.md, pyproject.toml, etc)
- create musort directory for library purposes:
  - add command-line argument parsing via `typed-argument-parser`
  - add various utility functions, classes for sorting
  - add locale folder to support different operating systems (in theory)
- implement --folder-mode sorting

## module_v2 : 0.0.2 - 2022.07.07

## module_v2 : 0.0.3 - 2022.12.20

Bug fixes.

- modify --folder-mode sorting to catch all OSErrors, as opposed to just FileExistsError, PermissionError
- move musort/locale/ to musort/os_locale/ so as to avoid conflict with the standard library

## master : 0.1.0 - 2022.12.28

- move musort/ once more to src/musort/, to make script change possible
- remove build.sh in favor of Makefile
- update setup.py, README.md to match all stated changes

## master : 0.2.0 - 2023.04.11

- add musort_conf, musort-conf to list of accepted configuration paths
